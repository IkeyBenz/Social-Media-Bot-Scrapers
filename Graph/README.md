# Social Network Graph

This social network graph uses the **data/** generated by an [`InstagramScraper()`](https://github.com/IkeyBenz/Social-Media-Bot-Scrapers/blob/master/instagram_bot_scraper.py#L14) instance, using the [`cli.py`](https://github.com/IkeyBenz/Social-Media-Bot-Scrapers/blob/master/cli.py) script.

The [`analysis.py`](https://github.com/IkeyBenz/Social-Media-Bot-Scrapers/blob/master/Graph/analysis.py) file contains a function that converts the .txt data
into a [`Graph()`](https://github.com/IkeyBenz/Social-Media-Bot-Scrapers/blob/master/Graph/graph.py#L11) object. From there, you can perform three operations on it:
1. `order_influencers(graph, n=5)`: Takes a networkx graph object and returns the n most connected vertices, aka most influential accounts in this network.
2. `shortest_path_between(graph, acc1, acc2)`: Takes a networkx graph object and two accounts. Returns the accounts in the smallest path between them.
3. `display_communities(graph)`: Takes a networkx graph object and approximates communities of accounts based on edge density of nearby nodes. Itterates through all possible communities and prints them out individually.
